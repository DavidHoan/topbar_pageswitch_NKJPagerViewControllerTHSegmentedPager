THSegmentedPager  
===

This control combines the great [HMSegmentedControl](https://github.com/HeshamMegid/HMSegmentedContro) with a UIPageviewController that takes care of showing the right page when clicking on the HMSegmentedControl and updating the selection when the UIPageviewController scrolls.

# Installation

I'm planning to release it as pod sooner or later

### Manually

Copy the folder into your project, wire the outlets and fill the control with pages
